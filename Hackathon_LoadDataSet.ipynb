If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create one using the same email address used to book your original flight. Apply your credit We can’t apply a credit later to a flight you’ve already booked. Starting from the Coupons and credits page or the Virtual Agent means the credit will be applied to your flights when it’s time to check out. There are generally no physical vouchers or codes sent from the airline or us. It’s an electronic credit stored in our systems. Where is my remaining value? Credit for the remaining value follows the same rules as the original credit. Airline policy decides if you get to keep the remaining value after rebooking. If you don’t see a credit balance on your Coupons and credits page , check the confirmation email for your new flight. It may have the info you’re looking for. Still can’t find it? Contact our agents who can help track it down. For faster service, have your canceled itinerary number and ticket numbers handy. Expiration dates Check the Coupons and credits page of your account, or in the Virtual Agent, for the latest dates the airline has given us connected to your credit. There are likely dates you need to book by, start your travel by, and complete your travel by. Airlines usually give you 12 months from the original booking date to rebook with a credit before it expires. What happens to your credit after those dates depends on airline policies. Expired credit Airlines don’t usually extend credit expiration dates. But, for those flights canceled due to COVID-19, many airlines have extended expiration dates by 12-18 months. We follow the airline’s policies for your ticket, which means we’re unable to extend the dates for you. If the airline extended your credit dates, it should be reflected in the airline’s policies and in your Coupons and credits info. Once the credit expires, we no longer have access to it, and you’ll need to contact the airline for help and with questions. Redeem on our site Redeem your airline credit from the Coupons and credits page in your account or in the Virtual Agent. Follow the instructions to enter a shopping path dedicated to credits. If you don't see your credits here, contact an agent for help. Redeem with the airline Some airlines require you to use the credit where you originally booked. We recommend redeeming on our site first , but you can also check the airline’s site to see if you can redeem there. On the airline site, you’ll need the ticket numbers from your canceled flights. Find these in your canceled itinerary on the Trips page. Search for eligible flights Starting your search from the Coupons and credits page or the Virtual Agent is the only way to redeem your credit through the website! Your credit will be automatically applied to your flight search. We can’t apply a credit to a flight you’ve already booked. If there’s a change fee for rebooking, we’ll let you know when you're shopping. But most airlines have waived change fees for flights that were changed or canceled as a result of COVID-19. Cash instead of credit Airlines don't typically offer refunds , unless you bought a refundable ticket. To be sure, check the airline website to see if there’s a choice to request a refund online. Credit from low-cost airline Low-cost airlines (like Frontier or Spirit) require you to contact them directly to redeem credit . Check the airline’s website for instructions and details on the flights you can choose. Flight credit rules We follow the policies of our partners. The airline website will have the specific rules for your credit and flights you can choose. There are some general rules that are almost always true. Credit can only be used: By the original ticket holder For flights with the airline that issued the credit For flights costs, not extras like baggage fees, meals, or upgrades Prices and payment The cheapest flights that you find online may not be eligible for purchase with a credit because of airline restrictions that apply to your credit. These restrictions plus fare specifics (like class or cabin), can cause price differences between what you see in your search results here vs. our regular search options or on other sites. Paying for extra You'll need to pay with a credit card for fare costs left after the credit has been applied. Use a credit card for any extras too (like meals, upgrades, insurance, etc.). Airline credit can’t be applied for anything other than the fare. You can pay for extras at checkout on our site or through the airline website after you’ve rebooked. Redeem for multiple travelers If you have more than one traveler with credit, you can redeem through the website if you’re using the credits for all travelers on the canceled itinerary at the same time. The credits must be redeemed only for the original traveler and can’t be combined. But, if there’s at least one person from the canceled itinerary that doesn’t want to redeem yet (or wants to go somewhere else), contact an agent. They can help you split up the credits and rebook flights. Understand your search results If you found a flight elsewhere that doesn’t appear in your search results here, it could be because the fares don’t qualify for credit redemption (based on airline rules). Here are some examples of how credit terms and conditions may impact your flight options: Credit may only be valid for a certain airline You may only be permitted to choose a certain origin or place of departure You may only be permitted to choose a certain destination Credit may only be valid for the same fare class as originally purchased (Basic Economy, business class, etc.) Credit may not allow cabin changes from the original ticket (like First class to economy)\", 'relevanceScore': '0.0', 'product': ['Flight||flight'], 'intent': []}\n",

Here’s what you should know. Flight canceled during COVID-19 times? If you have a flight credit that’s more than three years old, your credit might not appear in Trips or on your Coupons and Credits page. In that case, you’ll need to contact your airline directly to redeem your credit. Your confirmation email should have your ticket number and airline confirmation code. Have a credit on a low-cost airline? To redeem an airline credit from a\\u202flow-cost airline, such as Frontier or Spirit, contact the airline directly. Before you redeem your airline credit All you need is your itinerary number and ticket number in Trips —no voucher necessary. Airline credits come with a travel-by date, so be sure to factor this into your planning. Airlines give separate credits to each traveler; you won’t be able to combine or transfer credits. The credit can be used only with the airline that provided the credit, and there may be fare class and cabin restrictions. Airline credits can’t be used for additional services, like meals, seat upgrades and so on. Your new flight must depart from the same country as was shown on your original ticket. How to use your airline credit Check your cancellation email for details about your airline credit—such as traveler names, credit amount, departing and arriving airports, ticket numbers and expiration dates.

If the credit doesn’t show in your account, contact us and one of our friendly agents will help you with your booking. Make sure you have the original itinerary number, credit amount, and traveler names handy. Good to know If your new flight costs more than your airline credit amount, you must pay any remaining difference. Some airlines only allow you to use up to the value of the credit received on a single trip, meaning you would lose any credit left over. This is per the airline’s policy that's included in your cancellation email. If you do have credit left over that you’re eligible to use, contact us and we’ll help you. If you choose a different destination when booking with an airline credit, some taxes may be forfeited, and new ones introduced.

Here’s how it works. Booking a child's ticket You’ll need to purchase a separate ticket if: You book an international flight. Your child is 2 years old or older at takeoff. Your child needs his or her own seat. In some cases, children can fly for free. If everything below is true, you won’t need to buy your child a separate ticket: You book a domestic flight. Your child is an infant (less than 2 years old) at takeoff. Your infant sits in the lap of a traveler who meets the minimum age requirement. Each airline determines the minimum age requirement, make sure to call your airline for the details. Only 1 infant sits in the lap of that traveler. Now for the rules, airline policy states that one traveler who meets the airline’s minimum age requirement may accompany up to 2 infants, however each infant must be seated in their own seat. Flight discounts for children You can easily snag any available discounts while searching for your flight, just include how many children are flying and their age. The flights that come up will automatically be the best deals based on a few factors – what flight you’re on, how many seats are available, and how old your kids are. Documents a child will need The airlines determine what documents you’ll need to travel. In a nutshell, if you’re flying domestically, each child might need a photo ID. If you’re flying internationally, each child will need a valid passport. Children traveling without both parents may need to provide notarized documentation and letters of permission to enter another country. Please confirm your specific document requirements with your destination's embassy or consulate. Car seats Some airlines require children with their own ticket to sit in a car seat that fits and locks into the airplane seat. Strollers When going through airport security, fold your stroller and send it through the scanner with your other belongings. If you choose to check your stroller, many airlines will allow you to do so free of charge. Still need help?

If the flight price is lower than what you paid, you’ll get a refund for the difference. Feel free to also check for price drops yourself on the Price Drop Protection Dashboard . We will refund you the lowest confirmed Price Check. We’ll only compare prices against flights on Expedia that exactly match your flight. For example, the same carrier, flight class, and route. To buy Price Drop Protection Choose your flight and add Price Drop Protection, which is offered on select flights. If you ever want to check for price drops yourself: Open your flight itinerary . Under Price Drop Protection , follow View price changes . You can check for price changes on the Price Drop Protection Dashboard from the day you book until the day your flight departs.

You should see the refund credited to the original form of payment within 7 business days of your trip completion. You can also track your refund by clicking View price history on your Expedia itinerary. Price Drop Protection Terms & Conditions In addition to the Expedia terms of use , the following terms and conditions govern Price Drop Protection (\"Price Drop Protection\"): A “Price Check” determines if there is an exact match of the original Expedia Itinerary on flights available for all listed travelers based upon: base fare, taxes, and any mandatory fees charged by airports or airlines. Any additional fees or costs (such as Expedia booking fee, if any, or purchases of checked baggage and seat selection) are not considered. Price Checks only checks prices that are available to the general public on Expedia. Special discounted prices such as those available only to loyalty-program members, and prices offered as part of a flight + hotel travel combination are not checked, as they are not eligible. If a Price Check identifies a lower price on Expedia, the difference between the lower price and the price originally paid for the flight(s) on the Expedia Itinerary will be confirmed. Following each Price Drop Protection purchase, Expedia will automatically conduct Price Checks on Expedia for the flight(s) listed on the original Expedia Itinerary. A Price Drop Protection purchase gives the purchaser the ability to initiate a Price Check by clicking the designated Price Drop Protection Dashboard link on the Expedia Itinerary. The “Price Drop Protection Payment” is the difference between the price you paid for your original flight booking and the lowest confirmed Price Check on the Price Drop Protection Dashboard. The Price Drop Protection Payment, if any, will be refunded as a credit to the form of payment used to book the original Expedia Itinerary after the flight(s) have concluded. If Price Checks confirm more than one lower price on an exact match of the original Expedia Itinerary, there will be only one Price Drop Protection Payment in an amount equal to the lowest confirmed Price Check as compared to the price paid for the flight(s) on the original Expedia Itinerary. Changes to flight(s) on the original Expedia Itinerary may result in: (i) cancelation of Price Drop Protection; (ii) forfeiture of any Price Drop Protection Payment; and (iii) a full refund of the Price Drop Protection price paid, if any. In order to be eligible for a Price Drop Protection Payment, travel, as reflected on the original Expedia Itinerary, must be completed by all travelers. If it is not, then Price Drop Protection will be cancelled. You can cancel Price Drop Protection within 24 hours of purchase and receive a full refund of its price paid, if any. 24 hours after purchase, Price Drop Protection is non-refundable and has no cash value. If Price Drop Protection is cancelled, no Price Drop Protection Payment will be issued. Price Drop Protection is offered only on select flights.
